# DCS-CC (DCS Campaign Controller)
Welcome to our project of DCSCC, which is a series of tooling to work with online campaigns for use in DCS. Our project aims to create tools which can be used to split missions between sides, to allow mission makers to place waypoints on their individual missions which are merged together.
